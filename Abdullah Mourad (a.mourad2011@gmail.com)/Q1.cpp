// using c programming language 
// mainly there are 3 ways to solve this,  first by jumping one by one rocket until we reach the end 
// or by jumping two by two until reach the end and that would mean that N (total numbers of rocks is even number)
// finally, I think the best way is to mix the jumps is the most suitable  for this case
